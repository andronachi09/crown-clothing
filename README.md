## Reflection

The project represents an example which integrates different technologies for creating and web application. During learning
process I have consolidated my knowledge regarding React and Hooks. Other than that I have learned to deploy to production
by using Netlify. The authentication was set with Firebase, which helps for creating new accounts and managing them. Also,
when we talk about state which initally was set as local, later was shared across components by using Context API. Later,
instead of Context API, Redux was used. Also, Stripe was integrated, but just for testing puroses. The deployed app can be
